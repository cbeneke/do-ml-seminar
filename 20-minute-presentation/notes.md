## Time Allocation Notes
- Keep introduction concise but engaging
- Core theory section should be thorough but accessible
- Implementation section is the main focus
- Leave buffer time for questions within sections
- Prepare additional slides for potential questions

## Key Visualizations to Include
1. Architecture diagrams for each implementation
2. Training loss curves comparison
3. Visual results for both frequency cases
4. Performance metrics comparison table

## Presentation Tips
- Start with the problem statement
- Use animations for step-by-step explanations
- Include code snippets for key implementation differences
- Prepare interactive demonstrations if time permits
