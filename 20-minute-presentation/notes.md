# Neural Implicit Flow: A Comparative Study
## Speaker Notes

### Catchphrase
- Imagine trying to model ocean temperatures or airflow around an aircraft wing

### Title Slide
- Brief personal introduction
- Acknowledge the original NIF paper authors
- Set context: "Today I'll present our comparative study of different Neural Implicit Flow implementations"

### Outline
- Quick overview of structure
- Emphasize focus on implementation comparison
- "We'll look at three different implementations and their performance characteristics"

### Introduction

#### Problem Space & Motivation
- SVD: Singular Value Decomposition
- CAE: Convolutional Autoencoder
- Key points:
  - High-dimensional data is everywhere in scientific computing
  - Traditional methods struggle with real-world complexity
  - Need for better tools is pressing

- Walk through limitations systematically:
  - SVD: "While mathematically elegant, breaks down with variable geometry"
  - CAE: "Requires fixed grids, limiting real-world applications"
- Connect to audience: "If you've worked with CFD or climate models, you've likely encountered these limitations"

### Neural Implicit Flow Framework

#### Core Architecture
- Use architecture diagram effectively:
  - Start with big picture: "Two networks working together"
  - Explain flow: "Spatial coordinates go here, temporal data there"
  - Highlight key innovation: "The magic happens in how these networks interact"
- Real-world analogy: "Think of ShapeNet as a specialized tool that adapts based on ParameterNet's instructions"

#### Mathematical Formulation
- From slides

### Implementation Approaches (5 minutes)

#### Overview
- Set context: "We implemented this framework in three different ways"
- Why three versions?: "Each approach has its own strengths"
- What we learned: "This comparison revealed interesting trade-offs"

#### Implementation Details
Key talking points:
- Upstream: "Based on original paper, but modernized"
- TF Functional: "Complete redesign focusing on functional principles"
- PyTorch: "Leveraging modern framework features"

### Experimental Setup

#### Test Cases
- Low Frequency:
  - "Simple case to establish baseline"
  - Point out key visualization features

- High Frequency:
  - "This is where things get interesting"
  - Explain why this case is challenging (high frequency, ReLU doesn't work well)

### Results and Analysis (4 minutes)

#### Performance Overview
- Start with headline results:
  - "Modern implementations significantly outperformed baseline"
  - PyTorch Adam most stable between low and high frequency
- Processing Speed (not in slides):
  - All implementations achieved practical speeds

### Optimiser Impact
- PyTorch drastically better with Adam than AdaBelief
- Original paper implementation only one which is (slightly) better with AdaBelief

#### Visual Results
- Walk through visualizations:
  - "Left shows ground truth"
  - "Middle shows predictions"
  - "Right shows error - notice the scale"
- Point out interesting features:
  - Areas of high accuracy
  - Challenging regions
  - Implementation differences

### Conclusions

#### Key Findings
- Emphasize practical implications:
  - Framework choice matters
  - Optimizer selection is crucial
  - Real-world viability


### Questions
- Prepare for common questions:
  - Why these specific test cases?
  - Framework selection criteria
  - Performance bottlenecks
  - Real-world applications
