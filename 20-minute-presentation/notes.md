### Neural Implicit Flow Framework (4 minutes)

#### Core Architecture
- Use architecture diagram effectively:
  - Start with big picture: "Two networks working together"
  - Explain flow: "Spatial coordinates go here, temporal data there"
  - Highlight key innovation: "The magic happens in how these networks interact"
- Real-world analogy: "Think of ShapeNet as a specialized tool that adapts based on ParameterNet's instructions"

#### Mathematical Formulation
- Keep it accessible:
  - "Don't worry about the details of the equations"
  - Focus on intuition: "What we're really doing is mapping space and time to a value"
  - Emphasize practical significance: "This formulation allows us to handle any point in space and time"

### Implementation Approaches (5 minutes)

#### Overview
- Set context: "We implemented this framework in three different ways"
- Why three versions?: "Each approach has its own strengths"
- What we learned: "This comparison revealed interesting trade-offs"
